 #### *GeoDEN* is a Geographic Visual Analytics tool, visualizing Dengue and its 4 serotypes over time and space.

By combining a map of reports with other visualizations and the power to select a specific place an time, GeoDEN enables the user find novel insights as well as verify known knowlege and events.

### Dataset

*GeoDEN* uses Messina et al. 2014's global dataset of reports for the years from 1943 - 2013.

A supplementary dataset has been added to fill in more recent data, and this covers the years 2014 - 2020.
